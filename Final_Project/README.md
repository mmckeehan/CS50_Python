# About This Project
This is a project that will allow you to upload data (form of CSV) that is collected from an the Oura ring. You will then be able to create a graph or heatmap of the data from a selected range.

The minimum vialable product will be using the terminal to upload the file and selecting:
    - Date Ranges
    - What data you want
    - What kind of output you want
        - Line Graph
        - Heat Map

The "would like to have" is to have a graphical user interface that makes it easier for the end user to submit this data.
