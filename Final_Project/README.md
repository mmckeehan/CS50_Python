# About This Project
This is a small text based game where you will play as a woman exploring an old abandoned house. You will need to navigate around, avoiding obsticles and traps as you figure out the mystery of what had happened.

There will be a health system, a variety of rooms to explore, and some puzzles to solve.

As I am a gamer at heart with a desire to break into the industry, and I am trying to master the basics of programing in general, this seemed like the perfect project to start with.
